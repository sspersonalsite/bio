									<h1>Benefits of Centralized TPM Teams</h1>
									<p>#TPM #program #commentary</p>
								</header>	

									<p>As tech companies grow, managing complex and cross-functional programs becomes increasingly important. Engineering teams must focus on their technical responsibilities without being burdened by organizational coordination and communication challenges. This is where Technical Program Managers (TPMs) play a crucial role.</p>

									<h2>TPMs and Engineers: A Symbiotic Relationship</h2>

									<p>In a tech company, the relationship between TPMs and engineering teams can be likened to the human spine:</p>

									<ul>
									<li>Engineering Teams (Vertebrae): Just as vertebrae provide the structural integrity and support needed for the body to function, engineering teams are the foundation of a tech company. They develop core products, build infrastructure, and create systems that are essential for company success.</li>

									<li>TPM Teams (Spinal Cord): The TPM team functions like the spinal cord, facilitating communication and coordination across different parts of the organization. TPMs ensure that information flows seamlessly between teams, manage dependencies, and keep projects on track. They align the objectives of various departments, enabling efficient and cohesive operations throughout the company.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>The Importance of Centralizing TPM Teams</h2>
									<p>For TPMs to effectively fulfill their roles, they must operate independently of the technical teams they support. This independence allows them to manage cross-functional initiatives without bias, track dependencies, and make prioritization decisions based on the broader needs of the company. Here is why centralizing TPM teams is beneficial:</p>
									
									<ul>
									<li>Enhanced Coordination: Centralized TPMs have a holistic view of company objectives, which helps in aligning efforts across different teams and departments.</li>

									<li>Objective Prioritization: Independent TPM teams can prioritize projects based on overall company goals rather than the needs of individual technical teams, leading to more strategic decision-making.</li>

									<li>Risk Management: With a centralized structure, TPMs can more effectively identify and mitigate risks across various projects, ensuring smoother execution and fewer bottlenecks.</li>

									<li>Improved Collaboration: Centralization fosters better collaboration and reduces duplicative efforts, as TPMs can see the big picture and coordinate resources more efficiently.</li>

									<li>Bridging Gaps: TPMs serve as a bridge between engineering teams (as well as other organizations like operations), reducing friction and improving communication between these critical areas.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h2>Insights from Industry Leaders</h2>
									<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiavicent/">Sophia Vicent</a>, VP Engineering at DoorDash, emphasizes the value of centralized TPM teams in her article, <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2021/08/02/6-principles-for-building-a-world-class-tpm-team/">"6 Principals for Building a World Class TPM Team"</a>. According to Vicent, centralizing TPM functions allows these teams to focus on the most impactful projects and align their efforts with the company mission. She notes that centralized TPM teams can:</p>

									<ul>
									<li>Leverage Resources Effectively: By being a centralized function, TPMs can concentrate on high-priority tasks that drive the most value.</li>

									<li>Ensure Strategic Alignment: Centralized teams can better align their projects with the company overarching goals, ensuring consistency and coherence in execution.</li>
									
									<li>Foster Best Practices: A centralized structure allows TPMs to share best practices and insights, leading to improved efficiency and innovation.</li>
									</ul>

									<p><br />Centralizing TPM teams within tech companies enhances their ability to manage complex programs, align cross-functional efforts, and drive strategic initiatives. By serving as the spinal cord of the organization, TPMs ensure that the engineering backbone operates smoothly and effectively, contributing to the overall success of the company.</p>
