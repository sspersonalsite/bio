- TPM teams remain lean through a centalized structure
- Centralized teams provides an organization-wide view

Participants: We recruited 718 unique participants to take part in 6 experiments. 97 participants were excluded for
failing an internet check question, leaving a total of 621 participants: 343 male, 271 female, and 7 other. Mean
participant age was âˆ¼ 38 years old. All participants were recruited through Positly, which maintains a whitelist of
high-performing workers from Mechanical Turk. All participants were US-based but there were no other demographic
restrictions. Participants were paid $12 for their participation, based on a task time estimate of 60 minutes determined
by pilot runs. In order to ensure that the sample of participants for each experiment quiz was unique, participants were
not allowed to take part in an experiment more than once.
